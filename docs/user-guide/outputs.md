# Outputs

This page describes the **output files** generated by ED2 and explains their
structure, contents, and interpretation.
All output files are written in plain-text format unless otherwise noted.

For reproducibility and long-term usability, output formats are designed to be
stable across ED2 versions whenever possible.

---

## General conventions

- Output files are written to the current working directory unless specified otherwise.
- File names are constructed using the `OUTPUT_PREFIX` parameter.
- Columns are space-separated.
- Floating-point values are written in double precision.
- Energies are reported in the **same units as the Hamiltonian parameters**.

---

## Standard output (stdout)

During execution, ED2 prints information to standard output, including:

- basic model and lattice information,
- Hilbert-space size (full or truncated),
- solver configuration,
- iteration and convergence messages,
- final eigenvalues.

Standard output is intended for **human inspection and diagnostics** and should
not be parsed programmatically.

---

## Energy eigenvalues

### File name

```
<OUTPUT_PREFIX>_energies.dat
```

### Description

This file contains the computed energy eigenvalues.

### Format

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Eigenvalue index (starting from 1) |
| 2 | Energy |

Energies are sorted in ascending order.

---

## Ground-state observables

### File name

```
<OUTPUT_PREFIX>_observables.dat
```

### Description

This file reports expectation values of selected observables evaluated
in the ground state (or lowest computed eigenstate).

### Format

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Observable identifier |
| 2 | Expectation value |

The set of observables depends on the input configuration and compiled features.

---

## Excited-state data (optional)

If multiple eigenvalues are requested, additional data may be written.

### File name

```
<OUTPUT_PREFIX>_excited.dat
```

### Description

Information related to excited states, such as excitation energies
relative to the ground state.

---

## Wavefunction output (optional)

### File name

```
<OUTPUT_PREFIX>_wavefunction.dat
```

### Description

When `WRITE_WAVEFUNCTION = true`, ED2 writes eigenvector components
in the chosen basis representation.

### Notes

- Wavefunction files can be large.
- The basis ordering follows the internal ED2 convention.
- This output is primarily intended for advanced post-processing.

---

## Log and diagnostic files

Depending on verbosity and solver settings, additional diagnostic files
may be produced, including:

- iteration logs,
- convergence histories,
- timing information.

These files are intended for performance analysis and debugging.

---

## File overwrite behavior

- Existing files with the same name are **overwritten**.
- Users should move or rename output files if multiple runs are performed
  in the same directory.

---

## Validation and consistency checks

When validating results, users are encouraged to:

- verify that the reported Hilbert-space dimension matches expectations,
- confirm convergence of iterative solvers,
- compare ground-state energies against known limits or smaller systems.

---

## Reproducibility notes

For published calculations, archive:
- all input files,
- all output files used in analysis,
- the ED2 commit hash,
- compiler and BLAS/LAPACK versions,
- OpenMP configuration.

These records ensure that numerical results can be independently reproduced.

- See **Validation and Performance** for benchmark results.
